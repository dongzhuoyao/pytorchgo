# LearningToCompare_FSL
PyTorch code for CVPR 2018 paper: [Learning to Compare: Relation Network for Few-Shot Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/1711.06025) (Few-Shot Learning part)

For Zero-Shot Learning part, please visit [here](https://github.com/lzrobots/LearningToCompare_ZSL).

# Requirements

Python 2.7

Pytorch 0.3

# Data

For Omniglot experiments, I directly attach omniglot 28x28 resized images in the git, which is created based on [omniglot](https://github.com/brendenlake/omniglot) and [maml](https://github.com/cbfinn/maml).

For mini-Imagenet experiments, please download [mini-Imagenet](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B3Irx3uQNoBMQ1FlNXJsZUdYWEE) and put it in ./datas/mini-Imagenet and run proc_image.py to preprocess generate train/val/test datasets. (This process method is based on [maml](https://github.com/cbfinn/maml)).

# Train

omniglot 5way 1 shot:

```
python omniglot_train_one_shot.py -w 5 -s 1 -b 19 
```

omniglot 5way 5 shot:

```
python omniglot_train_few_shot.py -w 5 -s 5 -b 15 
```

omniglot 20way 1 shot:

```
python omniglot_train_one_shot.py -w 20 -s 1 -b 10
```

omniglot 20way 5 shot:

```
python omniglot_train_few_shot.py -w 20 -s 5 -b 5
```

mini-Imagenet 5 way 1 shot:

```
python miniimagenet_train_one_shot.py -w 5 -s 1 -b 15
```

mini-Imagenet 5 way 5 shot:

```
python miniimagenet_train_few_shot.py -w 5 -s 5 -b 10
```

you can change -b parameter based on your GPU memory. Currently It will load my trained model, if you want to train from scratch, you can delete models by yourself.

## Test

omniglot 5way 1 shot:

```
python omniglot_test_one_shot.py -w 5 -s 1
```

Other experiments' testings are similar.
