# pytorch-deeplab

This repository contains codes for converting DeepLab ResNet 101 trained in caffe to pytorch model.

First, you need to have pycaffe and pytorch. Secondly, you should download the caffe models from [http://liangchiehchen.com/projects/DeepLabv2_resnet.html](http://liangchiehchen.com/projects/DeepLabv2_resnet.html).  Put them in data folder.

Then,

```
python convert2.py data/init.caffemodel model/deeplab101_init.pth
python convert2.py data/train_iter_20000.caffemodel model/deeplab101_trainaug.pth
python convert2.py data/train2_iter_20000.caffemodel model/deeplab101_trainvalaug.pth
```

The models generated by `convert2.py` expect RGB image ranging [0, 1]. You can use standard `trn.Normalize([0.485, 0.456, 0.406],[0.229, 0.224, 0.225])`.

You can train on `train_aug` and evaluate on `val` of PASCAL VOC2012 by 

```
python deeplab_main.py 0 train
python deeplab_main.py 0 eval
```

During evaluation you will also need to run `EvalSegResults.m` in the `matlab` folder to compute the mean IOU.

A large part of the code is borrowed from [https://github.com/ruotianluo/pytorch-resnet](https://github.com/ruotianluo/pytorch-resnet)

## Performance
The converted DeepLab ResNet 101 model achieves mean IOU of 75.382% on the validation set of PASCAL VOC2012. Note that this is only with the original resolution branch, without the 0.5 and 0.75 resolution.
